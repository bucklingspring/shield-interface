# S.H.I.E.L.D. Interface for macOS

This variant of the S.H.I.E.L.D. desktop wallpaper was intended for use on computers running macOS. Extra spacing has been added along the bottom to accomodate the dock. (If you prefer to have your dock hidden, you can run the wallpaper with all extra spacing off by loading **index_nospacing.html**)

## Instructions:
1. Download this repository as a ZIP. Extract the "mac" folder and place it somewhere out of the way.
2. Next, download and install [qdesktop](https://github.com/qvacua/qdesktop/wiki), a free and open source app that allows you to run HTML files as wallpapers. This is the software that we'll use in place of Wallpaper Engine.
3. Open qdesktop and set the wallpaper URL. In the URL field, enter the **index.html** or **index_nospacing.html** system path.
⋅⋅* Example: file:///Users/USERNAME/Documents/mac/index.html
