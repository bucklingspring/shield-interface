# S.H.I.E.L.D. Interface for macOS

This variant of the S.H.I.E.L.D. desktop wallpaper was intended for use on computers running macOS. Extra spacing has been added along the bottom to accomodate the dock. (If you prefer to have your dock hidden, you can run the wallpaper with all extra spacing off by loading "index_nospacing.html")
